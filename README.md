## Data Cleaning Process

The data for this dashboard was sourced from Kaggle. To ensure it was ready for analysis and visualization in Tableau, I performed a series of data cleaning steps:

1. **Dataset Download:** I obtained the dataset from Kaggle's website, which contained information about London bike rides.

2. **Data Import:** I imported the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and manipulation.

3. **Data Cleaning Steps:**

    - **Data Type Conversion:** I changed the data types for the "season" and "weather" columns into strings to make them more human-readable.

    - **Column Renaming:** I improved the column names to provide more meaningful and descriptive labels.

    - **Humidity Percentage:** I calculated and added a humidity percentage column to enhance the dataset's utility.

    - **Dictionary Creation:** I created a dictionary to map binary numbers for seasons and weather forecasts, making the data more accessible for analysis.

4. **Data Export:** The cleaned and enhanced dataset was then exported as "London_bikes_final.xlsx."

5. **Tableau Integration:** Finally, I imported the clean dataset into Tableau to create this interactive dashboard, allowing users to explore and visualize the London bike ride data effectively.
